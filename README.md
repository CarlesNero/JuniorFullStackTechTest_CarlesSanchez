# Tic-Tac-Toe SaaS Service

**Author:** Carles S√°nchez Moreno 

**Stack:** Kotlin (Spring Boot) + React + TypeScript + H2 Database  

---

## üìã Project Description

This project is a preliminary implementation of an **Tic-Tac-Toe SaaS service** following the VW Digital Hub technical test.  
It allows creating users, login, creating matches, making moves and checking the board status.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- **Backend:** Kotlin, Spring Boot, H2 database (in-memory, for ease of testing), logger implemented.  
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, DDD structure, tests implemented.  
- **Main API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/match/create` ‚Üí Creates a new match.
  - `POST /api/match/move` ‚Üí Makes a move in a match.
  - `GET /api/match/status?matchId={matchId}` ‚Üí Retrieves the current status of a match.
  - `GET /api/match/player/{playerId}/matches` ‚Üí Retrieves the current matches of a player.
  - `POST /api/player/login` ‚Üí User login.
  - `POST /api/player/register` ‚Üí User registration.

---

## üèó Architecture & Design

- **Clean Architecture** applied for separation of layers (domain, service, repository, controller).  
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** for both frontend and backend.  
- Logger implemented for **Monitoring and Observability** (using `stderr` with appropriate log levels).  
- Scalable and testable code, prepared for unit and integration testing.  
- Repositories configured for **dev**, **pre**, **pro** environments.

## üì¶ Setup & Deployment

### Backend

### Backend

1. Download the repository and open the backend project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).  
2. Run the application normally from the IDE.  
3. The server will start on **port 8585** automatically.  
4. No additional configuration is required; the backend uses an **H2 in-memory database** for easy testing.

### Frontend

1. Download the repository and open the frontend project in your IDE.  
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
````
To run the project 

```` bash
npm run dev
````

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Requirements

### Backend
- **Java 17** or higher
- IDE: IntelliJ, Eclipse, or similar

### Frontend
- **Node.js 18+**
- **npm 9+**
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### üß™ Tests


#### Backend

- Frameworks : JUnit and Mockito

```bash
mvn test
````

#### Frontend

```bash
npm run test
````


## üìù Technical Decisions & Implementation Details

### Game Rules Enforcement:

- Player X always starts the match.
- Machine plays as O and automatically selects and empty square randomly.
- H2 in-memory database is used **only for testing and development**; for production, PostgreSQL or MySQL should be configured.  
- Invalid moves (occupied square, wrong turn, or out-of-bounds) do not affect the game state.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Backend logs all actions using stderr with appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).

- Logs include player moves, machine moves, match creation, errors, and status updates.

- Designed for Observability and Monitoring in line with 12-factor app principles.

### Architecture & Code Quality:

- Clean Architecture separates layers: Controller, Service, Repository, Domain.

- DDD (Domain-Driven Design) applied to both backend and frontend.

- Scalable and maintainable code using SOLID principles.

- Fully unit-tested backend and frontend components.

### Database:

- H2 in-memory database used for simplicity and quick testing.

- Entities include User, Match, and Square.

- Square entity represents each cell on the Tic-Tac-Toe board and allows storing the current value (X, O, or null) to enable resuming matches mid-game.

- Relationships: a User can have multiple Matches; a Match contains multiple Squares.

### Frontend Design:

- React application with TypeScript and modular structure.

- Responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile.

- Clear UI for creating matches, making moves, and displaying match status.

## üöÄ Future Improvements & User Management

### User Management Enhancements:

- JWT-based authentication for secure login.

- Role-based access control (admin vs player).

- Endpoints: PUT /users/{id}, DELETE /users/{id}.

- Possibility of recovering unfinished matches to finish them, enabled by the Square entity, which persists the state of each board cell.

### Game Enhancements:

- Machine AI with smarter strategies instead of random moves.

- Multiplayer support for real-time gameplay with WebSockets.

- Persistent database for production environment (PostgreSQL or MySQL).

- Optional Dockerization for easier deployment and environment consistency.
